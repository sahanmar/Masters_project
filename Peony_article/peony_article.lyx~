1.
 Simple and Scalable Predictive Uncertainty Estimation using Deep Ensembles
 (Balaji Lakshminarayanan Alexander Pritzel Charles Blundell) - Nice approach
 of adversarial component in training ensembles.
 They showed how their approach of ensembles outperforms dropout technique.
 The results were shown on images MNIST, SVHN and ImageNet and toy problems.

 Can You Trust Your Model’s Uncertainty? Evaluating Predictive Uncertainty
 Under Dataset Shift (Yaniv Ovadia Balaji Lakshminarayanan Sebastian Nowozin)
 - Different methods for uncertainty representation are compared between
 each other.
 All these methods were testes on text data and image processing data.
 It turned out that ensembles showed the best performace with repect to
 all other methods.

1.
 Active Anomaly Detection via Ensembles (Shubhomoy Das, Md Rakibul Islam,
 Nitthilan Kannappan Jayakodi, Janardhan Rao Doppa) - Anomaly detection
 use case.
 They showed how it is possible to apply the weights for each ensemble where
 the weights are based on a feedback from an annotator.
 Nice approach of active learning on rescaling weights of each ensemble.

 Deep Bayesian Active Learning with Image Data (Yarin Gal, Riashat Islam,
 Zoubin Ghahramani ) - Active learning classification on images with respect
 to different acquisition functions.
 Good examples of which acquisition function can be used.

 ACTIVE LEARNING FOR CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS: A CORE-SET APPROACH
 (Ozan Sener, Silvio Savarese) - Core set approach.
 They try to cover training dataset with some multidimentional spheres in
 ordet to find the best learning subset that covers as much dataset as possible.
 Tested on Image Recognition and convolutional neural networks.
 
\end_layout

4.
 Learning Loss for Active Learning (Donggeun Yoo, In So Kweon) - Another
 approach with learning and predicting loss function.
 They do tell that they dont compare their method because for really large
 datasets dropout technique in too much computationally costly.
 Their algorithm works nicely for 1-10k image datasets.

1.
 Semi-Supervised Bayesian Active Learning for Text Classification (Sophie
 Burkhardt, Julia Siekiera, Stefan Kramer) - They are doing exactly the
 same thing that I do but with the usage of drop out based approach and
 ayes-by-Backprop (BBB) algorithm.
 The results are not cool at all.
 Mine are better

2.
 Practical Obstacles to Deploying Active Learning (David Lowell, Zachary
 C.
 Lipton, Byron C.
 Wallace) - Nice try with active learning.
 Very poor results.
 They used LSTM, SVM and CNN for active learning.
 They also used dropout in their work.
\end_layout

\lang american
3.
 Deep active learning for named entity recognition (Yanyao Shen, Hyokun
 Yun, Zachary C.
 Lipton, Yakov Kronrod, Animashree Anandkumar) - Dropout based active learning.
 They are also trying to reduce amount of the training data for NER models.
 They also consider sampling according to the measure of uncertainty proposed
 by Gal et al.
 (2017).

 Support Vector Machine Active Learning with Applications to Text Classification
 (Simon Tong, Daphne Koller) - The approach of active learning method for
 text classification that comes from 2001.
 They go through three techniques that show different queuing strategy.
 The results are better than in case of random sampling.
 However, no uncertainty was measured there.
 (Non bayesian way of querying).

5.
 Deep Active Learning for Text Classification (Bang An, Wenjun Wu, Huimin
 Han) - SVM and RNN (LSTM) multiclass text classification.
 No bayesian approach of neural networks.
 Trying to sample not 1 sample but batch.
 Their approach is only based on acquisition function.
 The uncertainty is measured only through output labels based on one set
 of parameters (point-wise estimate)

5.
 DEEP ACTIVE LEARNING FOR NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (Kashyap Chitta, Jose
 M.
 Alvarez, Adam Lesnikowski) - Active learning for NER.
 Same task as ours.
 They compare different models for example BALD, LC and so on.
 The active learning results are almost same.
 No significant difference seen there.
