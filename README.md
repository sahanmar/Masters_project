## Active Learning for Text Classification

![](/peony.png)

### Abstract 

Following project is aimed on derivition and testing of active learning techniques for text classification. Active learning method is intoroduced as semi-supervised learning algoithm that uses help from an annotator. When an algorithm is nit sure about a label of a specific instance, it will ask an annotator to provide the label. On the basis of the iterative annotators feedback the algorithms have more powerful ability for learning with lower amount of training documents. In this work, term classification is interpreted in different ways such as named entity recognition, anomaly context detection, binary classifiction, multiclass classifiction, etc.. In order to solve highlighted problems, in this work are used different methods such as random forests, svms, neural networks, etc.. Each method is defined with respect to decision theory paradigm and tested on real data with visualized results.

### Repository Guide

This Project is separated into two folders *Peony_research_document* and *Peopny_project*. 

*Peony_research_document* is a folder with output PDF document and .tex, .lyx files. T 

*Peopny_project* is a tech folder with codes.
